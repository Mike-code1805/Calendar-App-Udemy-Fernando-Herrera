# React Calendar

This repository is a technical introduction to PWA with React applications, remember that PWA is not a technology that only applies to React and here we will see how to integrate it in various ways.

We have the fundamentals and ways to work with the PWA using the default configuration offered by npx create-react-app

Specifically we will see:

- Service Worker
- Cache
- Facility
- Fetch
- Cache strategies
- Network first
- CacheOnly
- Network first with cache fallback

## WorkBox
Workbox is a tool that Google bought and now supports, that allows powerful, fast and easy configurations for the management of PWAs.

Here we learn:

- Detect Online and Offline from React
- Workbox
    - Wizard
    - Strategies
    - Background Sync
    - IndexedDB
    - Offline CRUD
- Optimizations of our service worker
